    The <b>HyperText Markup Language</b> or <b>HTML</b> is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as <u>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</u> and scripting languages such as <mark>JavaScript</mark>.
<br><br>
<del>Web browsers</del> receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes <sup> structure of a web page semantically <sub><big><big>and</big></big></sub> originally included cues for its appearance</sup>.
<br><br>
HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages.<i>With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page</i>.<small> html</small> provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as <big>headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items</big>. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.
